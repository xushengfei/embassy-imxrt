When you submit a pull request, a CLA-bot will automatically determine
whether you need to provide a CLA and decorate the PR appropriately
(e.g., label, comment). Simply follow the instructions provided by the
bot. You will only need to do this once across all repositories using
our CLA.

## Commit Message

* Use meaningful commit messages. See [this blogpost](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)

## PR Etiquette

* Create a draft PR first
* Make sure that your branch has `.github` folder and all the code linting/sanity check workflows are passing in your draft PR before sending it out to code reviewers.

## Careful Use of `Unsafe`

Working with embedded, using of `unsafe` is a necessity. However, please wrap unsafe code with safe interfaces to prevent `unsafe` keyword being sprinkled everywhere.

## RFC Draft PR

If you want feedback on your design or HAL driver early, please create a draft PR with title prefix `RFC:`.

## Clean Commit History

We disabled squashing of commit and would like to maintain a clean commit history. So please reorganize your commits with the following items:

* Each commit builds successfully without warning from `rustc` or `clippy`
* Miscellaneous commits to fix typos + formatting are squashed

## Regressions

When reporting a regression, please ensure that you use `git bisect` to find the first offending commit, as that will help us finding the culprit a lot faster.
